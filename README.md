# Comparative Image Filtering
## Without Noise
This is a part of my minor project in which I applied the following filters to the MNIST dataset and analyzed their overall accuracies.

1. Mean Filtering
2. Median Filtering
3. Bilateral Filtering
4. Gaussian Filtering
5. Spatial Filtering
6. Temporal Filtering
7. Box Blur Filtering
8. Laplacian/Mexican Hat Filtering
9. Canny Edge Filtering

## With Noise
To analyze the performance of the filters better, I added the following types of noise and calculated the 

## Features

- Application of various image filtering techniques.
- Training a CNN on filtered images for classification.
- Evaluation of classification accuracy.
- Visualizing original and filtered images.

## Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess and classify MNIST images using different filters.

3. Observe the classification accuracy and visualize original and filtered images.
