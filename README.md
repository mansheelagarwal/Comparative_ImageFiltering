# Comparative_ImageFiltering

This project demonstrates the application of various image filtering techniques to preprocess the MNIST dataset and improve image classification accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The project includes the following image filtering techniques:

1. Mean Filtering
2. Median Filtering
3. Bilateral Filtering
4. Gaussian Filtering
5. Spatial Filtering
6. Temporal Filtering
7. Box Blur Filtering
8. Laplacian/Mexican Hat Filtering
9. Canny Edge Filtering

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore how different image filtering techniques can enhance the quality of images in the MNIST dataset, making them more suitable for classification. It evaluates the impact of these filters on image classification accuracy using a CNN.

## Features

- Application of various image filtering techniques.
- Training a CNN on filtered images for classification.
- Evaluation of classification accuracy.
- Visualizing original and filtered images.

## Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess and classify MNIST images using different filters.

3. Observe the classification accuracy and visualize original and filtered images.
